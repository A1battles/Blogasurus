    <h3> Be brave </h3>
      <p> It's hard and the road ahead of you is tough. But you are tougher.
        You deserve the world don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you're
        willing to put in the work you will own
        it! <div style="float: right;"><img src= "lion.jpg"/></div></p>

    <h3> Be Kind </h3>
      <p> no one wants an evil dictator. Taking over the world will be a lot
        easier if you aren't actively trying to make enemies. People will love
        you, basically let you take over, if they think you'll treat them right.
        Help them and they will give you your throne </p>
